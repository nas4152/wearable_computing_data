Summary of Experiment and Analysis
----------------------------------
The experiment collected data from a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope as
30 subjects performed each of 6 activities.
The analysis focuses on mean and standard of deviation data reported in the 
experiment, including variables that are computations relying on mean values
(ie angles calculated using gravityMean).  Means were calculated for these 
variables for each subject and each activity.

Experiment Details
------------------

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

Description of Variables in Dataset
-----------------------------------
Each row in the dataset represents a subset of the observations in the original
experiment.  The column values are determined as follows:

1. group_type : indicates whether the means in that row are calculated for a
"subject" or "activity" subset

2. group : indicates the subset that is used for the means reported in the row - 
for "subject" rows, the value is a number id from the original experiment to 
identify a particular volunteer in the study; for "activity" rows, the value is 
a description of the activity performed

For columns 3:88, the variable in question is averaged across the subset 
indicated by the group column.

Variable details
----------------
Each mean represents a variable reported in the original paper.  See experimental detail (last 3 paragraphs) for information on time vs frequency variables as 
well as methods for determining the various tri-axial acceleration and angular velocity variables.  X, Y, and Z indicate the spatial axis of the measurement.  
All variables were normalized and bounded within [-1,1] (before mean
calculation).  

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean 
        frequency
angle(): Angle between to vectors. (angle variables included when they rely
        on mean data over the signal window as described below)

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
