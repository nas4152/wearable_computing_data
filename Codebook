Summary of Experiment and Analysis
----------------------------------
The experiment collected data from a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope as
30 subjects performed each of 6 activities.
The analysis focuses on mean and standard of deviation data reported in the 
experiment, including variables that are computations relying on mean values
(ie angles calculated using gravityMean).  Means were calculated for these 
variables for each subject and each activity.

Breakdown of variables in dataset
---------------------------------
Each row in the dataset represents a subset of the observations in the original
experiment.  The column values are determined as follows:

1. group_type : indicates whether the means in that row are calculated for a
"subject" or "activity" subset

2. group : indicates the subset that is used for the means reported in the row - 
for "subject" rows, the value is a number id from the original experiment to 
identify a particular volunteer in the study; for "activity" rows, the value is 
a description of the activity performed

For columns 3:88, the variable in question is averaged across the subset 
indicated by the group column.  The variables used are:
